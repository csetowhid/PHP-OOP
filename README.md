# PHP OOP Concepts 
## Class
 - A Class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member functions.
 - Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables and together these data members and member functions define the properties and behaviour of the objects in a Class.
 - Categorization of real life objects according to its attributes (variables) and behaviour (function).
- A class is a blueprint for an object.  
 - Class is a template for objects


 ## Object
 - Object is a process of accessing a class value or proporties from outside the class.
 - Object is an instance of a class.

  ## Properties
  - Class member variables are called properties.
  - Properties are variables of an object. They are the values associated with the object. 
  - Properties are variable inside a class.


  ## Constructor
- A constructor is a special type of member function of a class which initializes objects of a class.

- In OOP Constructor is a special method. It is called whenever you create an object using new keyword. 

- Constructors are automatically called when an object is created from a class
